Description: Sliced Mean Variance Covariance Inverse Regression (SMVCIR) is a form of discriminant analysis that takes into account not only location differences among classes, but also variance and covariance differences between classes.  It may be useful both as a classification technique as well as a graphical technique when discriminant coordinates are plotted, and clear separation between classes can be easily seen.
